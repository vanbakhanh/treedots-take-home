# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
- I used vue3-google-map library to display the Google Map widget and haversine-distance library to calculate the distance between the user's location and hubs' location.

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

```bash
quasar dev
```

---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
- I would like to organize file structure for easy scalable and maintenance and add a search feature to easily find hub without scroll to finding, and add directions feature from user's location to the mark hub.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
- It's the displays the hubs on the list and on the map. I'm very excited when my code worked and displaying as I expected on the screen. I felt that I'm almost halfway there.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
- It's the handle events when clicking on the hub marker because it has much stuff to handle with this event. For example hide the label, center the map, excluding the hub from the list.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
- The test is fine.
